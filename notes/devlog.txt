🧪 Dev Log
Practical and conceptual notes weaved together.

🕸️ W3C Proposals To Watch:
- https://www.w3.org/TR/mediacapture-fromelement

☁️ Ideas
- Maybe aesthetic.computer is more of an interface project
  or search engine or *branded* prompt than it is a creative
  platform?

- Large scale re-organization:
  - Every piece is a set of functions.
  - Functions are like "plug-ins" to aesthetic.computer.
  - They enable certain device features like the ability to make a sound or
    display an image.
  - Code modules / libraries in aesthetic.computer are loaded based on the
    functions the piece uses.
  - New functionality can always be added and improved upon, and new global APIs
    can be created with this architecture in mind.
  ✨ Perhaps there is more power in smaller APIs than there is in larger APIs?

❓ Questions
- How does aesthetic.computer relate to urbit?

- What would editing lisp-like syntax feel like in VS code / my own
  browser editor?

🧑‍💻 Text Editor / Shell Notes
- [] https://github.com/ggandor/leap.nvim
- [] Start a blog or journal of some kind - that is sourced from
     this repository?
- [] Add hybrid bindings to fish: https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/blob/master/share/functions/fish_hybrid_key_bindings.fish

💻 Docs
-> GitHub Codespaces (Manual Setup):
  A. Clone my dotfiles repo and install chezmoi via the chezmoi/dotfiles install.sh script.
  B. For running the frontend:
    1. install git lfs to get media files: `git lfs install; git lfs pull`
    2. `cd` into `system` and then `npm install`
    3. login to netlify via `npx netlify login` and link the site with `npx netlify link`
    4. now you can `cd -` and then run `npm run code`
       to start the frontend, fully simulating the netlify production environment
       (with exception to the automatic https tunneling via nginx in the codespaces container)
  (Outdated) C. For running the server backend:
    1. `cd` into `server` and then `npm install`
    2.  add `NODE_ENV=development` to a `.env` file in `server`
    3.  Note: websockets (wss) cannot be port forwarded by codespaces atm 

-> Local Server (Notes):
  Use `fnm` (https://github.com/Schniz/fnm) and the .node-version file under
  `system` to manage node versions (currently the project is on lts/gallium [16])

***Recently Done***

* Start over with my dotfiles
  - [x] Get my dotfiles working (especially get fish running) in github codespaces.
  - [x] Wipe dotfiles repository.
  - [x] Start a fresh set from this codespace that simply symlinks a few things,
      like my fish settings, and installs anything I need via an install.sh script.
  - [x] Follow along here: https://bea.stollnitz.com/blog/codespaces-terminal
